## Technologies Used

    ```
3. Open the `html.html` file in your browser to see the Random Quote Generator in action.

## Code Explanation
- **HTML**: Contains a button that, when clicked, triggers the `getQuotes()` function to display a new quote.
- **CSS**: The container, button, and text are styled to look clean and centered on the page.
- **JavaScript**: The `getQuotes` function generates a random number, which it uses to select a quote from an array. The selected quote is then displayed in the `<p id="quote">` tag.

## Future Improvements
- Add a feature to save or share quotes.
- Fetch quotes from an external API to have a larger variety.
